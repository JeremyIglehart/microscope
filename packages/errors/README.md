I created this package by following the guide at [DiscoverMeteor.com](https://book.discovermeteor.com/chapter/creating-a-meteor-package) about how to publish a package.

This package is a pattern to display applications errors to the user.

Usage: Put `{{> meteorErrors}}` where you want errors to be.

Errors.throw('Error Text') to display the error.

This requires Bootstrap - I just don't know how to list the bootstrap package as a dependency yet :)

Most likely this package is of no use to you, and more for me.  Feel free to use it if you'd like.  There is NO LICENSE - use at your own risk.
